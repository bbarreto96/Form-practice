        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics">Genetic</a> studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins
        in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but<br>
        with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East<br>
        and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent.<br>
        From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in <br>western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th
        century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th<br> century BC, with the "bird that gives birth
        every
        day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and<br> Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of
        Thutmose
        III.[7][8][9]

    <p>
        The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl,<br> a subspecies of the red junglefowl
        (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread<br> domestic animals, with a total
        population of
        23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2]<br> There are more chickens in the world
        than
        any other bird or domesticated fowl.<sup><a href="Some source to link">[2]</a></sup> Humans keep
        chickens primarily<br> as a source of food
        (consuming both
        their
        meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for <br>cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
        chickens were not kept for food until<br> the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).<sub>[3][4]</sub>
